Introduction
============

It has been said that all models are wrong, but some are
useful.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>
This model attempts to find a level of generality that is broadly
useful. Too general, and the model becomes untethered to reality and
definitely not useful. Too specific, and the model will only work in
some cases.

This Identity and Access Management (IAM) Reference Architecture leans more towards technical
implementation and touches on some of the process, legal, and capability
dimensions. This breadth of coverage is intended to give the reader a
set of concepts that can be applied when thinking about IAM.

The principle behind this model assumes that the management of
identities and access can (mostly) be separated from their use. This
concept can apply to distributed systems as well as self-contained
systems. So, when you see IAM working together with, say, an
application, it may mean that these are separate physical systems.
Alternatively, it could mean these parts are separate pieces of software
running on a single system.

The main goal of this article is to allow consistent discussion of more
specific use-cases by offering a common set of terms and concepts to be
used across all IAM architectures.

While the model incorporates guidance from various standards and best
practice documents, the primary structure for the model started with the
ISO/IEC
framing.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) detail was removed for simplicity,
and the IAM model has been extended so that authorization, governance,
and risk-control can be included.

Some of the ISO/IEC names have been changed to reflect more common
usage. In some cases, the ISO names have been used in a more expansive
way than their original definition.

In an attempt to adopt the most useful terminology, the model has been
reviewed in conjunction with the
FICAM,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>
Internet2,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>
NIST SP-800-63
definitions,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>
NIST Zero Trust
frameworks,<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a>
and with the Identity Stack as presented at Identiverse
2019.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a>

The model can be used to support varying levels of system complexity.
For example:

-   in a Distributed System environment, where the architecture may have
    a web-hosted application the Relying Party (RP) that depends on a cloud identity
    service. the Identity Provider (IDP)). The RP, in this case, could be a
    customer-facing application or a workforce-facing application;

-   in a Single System model, where a computer’s file system (the RP)
    provides access control based on the user information acquired at
    login (the IDP). In this case, both the file system and IAM function
    are encapsulated in an operating system.

Terminology
===========

The terms are defined below. Those with a ✓ mark are the abstract
components that comprise the model.

Two of the terms, IDM and Access Management, are used for a conceptual
grouping of components. This is to aid understanding.

Basic Structure of the Model
============================

The most basic function of the identity system is to provide secure
storage of the information about identities and a way for Relying
Parties (RPs) to use that data to control access to resources. The
following diagram shows the core components of an identity management
system (IDM) that supports multiple RPs.

![](IAM-Ref-Arch-1.jpg)

*Figure 1: Basic Component Dependencies the IDM supports multiple
relying parties. The core components of the IDM are shown. The dotted
arrowed lines show dependencies*

Identity Management
-------------------

Identity Management (IDM) is a set of policies, procedures, technology,
and other resources for maintaining identity information. In this model,
it contains information about principals/subjects, including
credentials. It also includes other data such as metadata to enable
interoperability with other components. The IDM is shown with a dotted
line to indicate that it is a conceptual grouping of components, not a
full-fledged system in itself.

Relying Party
-------------

The Relying Party (RP) is a component, system, or application that uses
the IDM to identify its users. The RP has its own resources and logic.
It comes in many forms, all of which use identity services, including
systems, sub-systems, and applications, independent of the domain or
operator.

Trust Framework
---------------

This component represents the legal, organizational, and technical
apparatus that enables trust between the IDM and the RPs.

When the IDM and the RP are not in the same organization, the Trust
Framework takes on a salient aspect, resulting in multilateral or
bilateral agreements. In simple cases, this may be a contract between
two parties. In other cases, there may be a multilateral agreement. We
will use the term federation loosely to cover both cases. These
frameworks are described further in Laws Governing Identity Systems
(v2).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a>

These agreements, rules, and policies govern how the federation members
operate and
interact.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a>
The parties of a federation establish mutual agreement upon an
acceptable identity to be used between the parties in a federated
relationship (for instance, the level of assurance used) in order to
operate well. In addition, the definition and values of attributes of
federated identities should be agreed upon. The parties should agree on
the security/access policies of federated users between the parties in a
federated relationship. For instance, whether there are duties to notify
others in the event of security failures.

When IDM and the RP are in the same organization, the agreements may be
more tacit.

When the IDM and RP are both built into a single system framework that
allows for mutual trust may be completely opaque to the system operator,
although the system developer may be aware of the framework or at least its implications since he or she will need to implement mechanisms that support the trust.

Trust Root
----------

A trust root is a technical structure that provides the IDP and RP the
ability to recognize each other with a high degree of certainty. This is
similar to the concept of Trust Anchor (NIST SP.800-63-3), but we allow
for a structure that relies on a mutually agreed-upon third party. A
trust root derives from the operation of a Trust Framework. There is a
need for a trust root so that the systems can operate without human
involvement in every transaction. This may be done through a Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI), where the parties agree to trust a common
certificate authority that signs the certificates of all parties in the
federation. This may be done through a set of several independent
certificates that the parties agree to trust.

Provisioning
============

Provisioning is a term that encompasses the processes and methods that
create, modify, and, eventually, delete the identity and profile
information used by IT infrastructure and business applications. By
these methods, records are created or updated in the identity register
and removed from it. Often, provisioning needs to extend to applications
to support authorization decisions. This is sometimes known as
“downstream provisioning”. The term “Onboarding” is sometimes used to
refer to the sum of the initial provisioning activities in both the
identity and access aspects.

![Provisioning: The Identity register receives updates from one or more
external sources and administrative actions, passing the information on
as needed.](IAM-Ref-Arch-2.jpg)

*Figure 2: Provisioning: The Identity register receives updates from one
or more external sources and administrative actions, passing the
information on as needed.*

Identity Information Authorities
--------------------------------

While it is possible to have an IDM populated without attaching to an
external data service, this is typically not the case. Usually, employee
or customer data needs to be imported. This can be referred to as
upstream provisioning.

Note that the authoritative sources for identity attributes transcend
the HR system and may include email, phone, training certification
system, etc. In some cases, a company may have more than one HR system.

Governance
----------

The act of provisioning may include certain logic, best modeled as
governance. In some cases, the IGA system takes on all the provisioning
duties. See also [Access Governance](#access-governance).

Credential Services & Enrollment
--------------------------------

This function includes steps needed to originate and activate an
identity. It is also concerned with ongoing maintenance such as password
reset and key rotation. This function includes administrative activities
and self-serve activities.

Enrollment
----------

Also sometimes known as Registration. It involves such activities as
proofing, verification or vetting, and recording sponsorship if needed.
It also is responsible for the secure delivery of credentials.
Enrollment ends when a user formally receives ownership of their digital
identity and assumes control and ownership of their account’s
credentials.

Credential Services
-------------------

Credential services include the creation passwords,cryptographic keys, and other authenticators. 
It associates or "binds" these to an identity record. 

It is also concerned with ongoing maintenance such as password reset and key rotation and revocation of credentials as needed.

Identity Register
-----------------

This is the datastore that contains the enrolled entities and their
attributes, including credentials. In this model, we use the singular,
as if it were one singular database. In practice, designs may store some
attributes separately from identities. We also use this term to include
the storage related to credentials, although all or some of the
credentials may be stored in their own physical repository.

Identity Registers, by their nature, have high availability
requirements. Often at the physical level, they contain multiple
instances which are synchronized. The Identity Register could be
implemented in several ways. Common methods include the use of
general-purpose databases, optimized stores such as directories, either
physical or virtual.

Importing data does not necessarily mean making a physical copy of data,
although it often does. The notion also supports the idea of
virtualization - where the import of identity information is done at
run-time.

Service Provisioning Agent
--------------------------

Also noted is the function of propagating selected information further
into the ecosystem. This typically occurs when an RP needs additional
information about the users, e.g., for access control or
personalization. The RP makes a copy of the identity data for future use
in the application processes. A complete solution will support the full
data lifecycle, including creation, update, and eventual deletion of the
identity data stored locally.

Just in Time Provisioning
-------------------------

So far, the discussion of the provisioning function has been focused on
“admin-time”. However, there are some cases where provisioning occurs at
run time.

Not shown here, but sometimes implemented, are provisioning actions that
occur on a just-in-time basis. This can happen when additional identity
information is passed to an RP in real-time to support a specific
application requirement, possibly including identity attributes (See
Authentication and Sessions). A similar case involves the RP querying
the IDM to acquire attributes (see Authorization later in this document)

Audit Repository
----------------

The audit repository is shown to indicate the accumulation of historical
event data. To avoid clutter, we assume audit information is written but
call that out with arrows in the diagram.

Authentication and Sessions
===========================

Authentication
--------------

Authentication is the process by which a subject’s credentials are used
to verify their identity. The IDP checks and verifies credentials that
are presented to it. There are multiple scenarios. Typically, the RP
asks the Identity provider to gather the credentials from the user and
receives an assessment from the IDP regarding the level of certainty
that the user is authentic. Often the assessment (and more information
about the user) is delivered to the RP via a security token, which is
protected by cryptography. There are several varieties of security
tokens. The diagram uses bidirectional arrows to show that use cases exist that require ongoing exchange of information as describe in [Sessions](#sessions).

![Authentication and Sessions: The Identity Register supports
authentication scenarios. The IDP may monitor or participate if the full
session lifecycle with the Relying services.](IAM-Ref-Arch-3.jpg)

*Figure 3: Authentication and Sessions: The Identity Register supports
authentication scenarios. The IDP may monitor or participate in the full
session lifecycle with the relying parties.*

Sessions
--------

A common pattern is to associate the authentication event with the start
of a session. The session is mostly the concern of the RP. However, it
is sometimes desirable to keep the sessions of several relying parties
in synch. For instance, logging out of one session will terminate
concurrent sessions. To do this, often the IDP will act to orchestrate
sessions termination. In high-security environments, session management
must support termination based on real-time identity data, such as when
a user’s entitlements have been modified.

The existence of a centralized point of view about sessions can be
leveraged to support good security practices. For example, if the
identity attributes of a user with an active session change and these
new values then contravene an access control policy, the session should
terminate. If session management becomes aware of a terminated account,
it should end any active session that the user has. This could also
occur in advanced scenarios that include facts presented by external
risk monitors. See Risk Context below.

Sessions also support another important concept: step-up authentication.
A session can keep track of the level of assurance of a particular
authentication, so when a user requests access to a transaction or
application requiring a higher level of identity assurance, the IDP can
be prepared to determine the course of action, such as improving the
certainty that the user is the right person by asking the user provide
additional evidence. For example, maybe the password is good enough to
review some information, but to withdraw money, the additional factor of
a one-time password from a phone app is required. The detection of the
assurance gap and subsequent action will logically be done at the RP,
but to avoid a poor user experience in multiple RP scenarios, the
step-up needs to be recorded in the session.

Authorization
=============

Authorization models are many and diverse. The diagram illustrates two
approaches for authorization: local and shared. As noted below, both
approaches are subject to Access Governance.

Both approaches typically use subject attributes to help determine
access, although some systems rely on direct enumerations mapping users
to resources known as access control lists.

![Authorization models: Some RPs perform authorization tasks internally.
Sometimes authorization is a shared resource for many
RPs.](IAM-Ref-Arch-4.jpg)

*Figure 4: Authorization models: Some RPs perform authorization tasks
internally. Sometimes authorization is a shared resource for many RPs.*

Local Authorization
-------------------

Many Relying parties perform authorization tasks internally. Often the
fine-grained access control required by a protected resource makes this
appealing. For instance, a financial management system may maintain a
user’s entitlements to specific functionality within the application. In
this scenario, the application makes the authorization decision and
implements (enforces) the result.

The controlling values may have been provisioned into the local access
data store by the Provisioning process described above. Or the values
can be acquired at run-time from the IDM as shown by the attribute
query, which may provide the user’s role or other attributes during the
sign-on, perhaps as a value in the security token.

Shared Authorization
--------------------

Sometimes authorization is a shared resource for many Relying parties.
This design can improve the consistency of authorization decisions and
supports organizations wishing to include advanced access decisions
strategies such as those required by a “Zero Trust” access control
approach. Shared authorization systems typically have a consistent
approach to policy, such as a standardized policy language. In this
scenario, the RP asks the shared authorization function to make the
decision but implements (enforces) that itself.

Authorization Mechanisms
------------------------

In either approach, the access rights may be established, maintained,
and revoked in a variety of ways, starting with the existence and
validity of the digital identity. Other controls include various
mechanisms such as policies, roles, permissions, and identities. Some
controls rely on user attributes, including group memberships or roles
stored in an Identity Register. Some controls may depend on the
properties of the accessed resource or the context of the request, such
as time, device, or location.

Each mechanism relies on a particular logical data structure to
implement the access control; that data structure becomes the focus of
implementers. For instance, in role-based access control, there is some
art involved in “Role Management” (defining and managing a useful set of
roles) since too many roles become difficult to manage, whereas too few
leads to users with access to things they don’t need. Similarly, in the
case of policy-based access control, the set of policies (the Policy
Rules) needs to be designed, stored, and managed.

Access Governance
=================

Access Governance, also known as Identity Governance and Administration
(IGA), provides control over access rights implemented in multiple local
or shared authorization systems. This function is often broken into the
administration of these rights and the oversight needed to ensure that
these rights are in good order over time.

In enterprise systems, Access Governance focuses on managing staff
(employee/contractor) entitlements. The concept can also apply to other
scenarios, such as when business-to-business delegated administrative
rights are required or to in business-to-customer scenarios where
authorized third parties such as attorneys are required.

![Access Governance provides oversight and control over access rights
implemented in many Local authorization systems and, sometimes, in
Shared authorization systems.](IAM-Ref-Arch-5.jpg)

*Figure 5: Access Governance provides oversight and control over access
rights implemented in many Local authorization systems and, sometimes,
in Shared authorization systems.*

Control
-------

The controls may also include methods such as procedures and workflows
to ensure proper review. Typically, a request for access to resources is
passed to one or more approvers and an audit trail is created.

Often deployed to prevent internal fraud is the “segregation of duties”
control. The control defines groups of access rights that cannot be held
by the same person. This control is best implemented in a location that
has visibility to all the implicated access rights, i.e., the IGA
system.

Oversight
---------

Typically, governance activities review and potentially modify the data
in one or more of the authorization components in order to effect a
change in entitlements. Often organizations will have a formal process
to review existing entitlements and may require a responsible party to
certify or attest that the entitlements are in good order. Additional
tools to ensure that IAM policies are effective at enforcing their
stated controls include internal and external audits as well as analytic
reports.

Risk Context
------------

Risk Context (often abbreviated as RCTX) information can be valuable to
improve the security of the relying service. Risk can be judged based on
information in the request, information about the history of the user,
or assertions/evidence from third parties.

The linkage from the Audit Repository illustrates that the Risk Context
may consume the local historical data about events.

![Risk Context: It is possible to use risk information in authentication
decisions. For instance, if a stolen password is found on the dark web,
don’t allow login.](IAM-Ref-Arch-6.jpg)

*Figure 6: Risk Context: It is possible to use risk information in
authentication decisions. For instance, if a stolen password is found on
the dark web, don’t allow login.*

External events may be visible to the IDM operator through consortia or
vendor packages. In some mutual-support scenarios, it may be possible
for the IDM operator to also publish events for the benefit of others,
supporting other operators’ risk management requirements.

Events need to be delivered into the IDM so that they can selectively be
used to modify the behavior of the authentication function. For example,
armed with additional event data, the authentication function may
request a step-up authentication or even plainly deny access.

In some severe scenarios, attaching the events to the session management
function may be desirable so that current sessions can be reviewed and
terminated if needed. The OpenID Shared Signals and Events working group
is developing standard ways to deliver these signals.
<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a>

As shown in the diagram, shared authorization systems may consume risk
data as well. For example, an authorization might be denied if the
subject’s recent activity history is outside of normal bounds, possibly
indicating a compromised credential. Logically this could happen with
local authorization as well, but this is not shown.

Example: Information in the request
-----------------------------------

### Boundary control

An authentication or authorization decision may be influenced by
specific criteria, such as whether a request is coming from a known or
unknown network. A more sophisticated version of this attempts to
prohibit access from, say, certain countries.

Examples: Historical usage
--------------------------

### Usage pattern match

Determine if this request is outside the normal usage patterns for a
given individual. The reference to historical usage patterns allows for
pattern detection and can help establish a metric for risk for a user, a
specific transaction, or in general. Such activity can be called risk
profiling.

### Land speed violation

Amending the user’s request and history with location information makes
it possible to identify a likely compromised account because the user
can’t be in two places at once.

Such examples depend on signals from the local environment, but it is
also possible to obtain signals from further afield.

Example: Third party
--------------------

it is possible to determine commonly used passwords based on postings on
the “dark web.” Bad actors acquire these in the hope that users will use
the same password at other sites. A countermeasure is for the IDM
operator to require additional certainty if one of those passwords were
presented.

Metadata and Discovery
======================

Metadata refers to control data that allows the IDM and the Relying
Parties to interoperate.

![](IAM-Ref-Arch-7.jpg)

*Figure 7: Metadata and discovery these two functions are involved with
mutual recognition of the IDM and Relying Service.*

One example is the registration of public-key certificates to enable
mutual authentication. In some scenarios, this information is shared
between the parties manually. At run-time for distributed systems, the
technical root of trust is needed to validate the security channel (PKI)

Another example points out that configuration information is another
form of metadata. OpenID Connect has a list of required, recommended,
and optional values that describe a particular implementation aimed at
providing a degree of automation during setup.

The metadata may include information that limits the types of
interactions and scope of the data that is exchanged. It can also
contain security information to allow the counterparties to authenticate
each other. For instance, public key components such as certificates
with a common certificate authority may be used.

Discovery refers to protocols that facilitate automation. For instance,
OpenID Connect defines a method for RPs to locate an end-point where a
user’s identity can be
verified.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a>
The concept is more supported by other methods such as
SAML.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a>
A Discovery service can advise where specific data can be accessed and
which end-points are maintained to allow an RP to use the identity
service.

distributed session termination. He is a founding member of IDPro and
represented his firm in the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG).
Prior to his current position, he led the development of customer-facing
identity for websites at three other insurers. He has led a local
identity and access management user group since 2004. Prior to that, he
was the chairman of the Network Applications Consortium.
