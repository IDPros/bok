Editor's Note: This is a consolidated list of the terminology
highlighted in each of the articles published in the BoK. It is not, by
any means, a definitive or even broadly supported set of definitions;
the context an individual reader brings to the table will influence how
accurate the terminology for their use case. We offer the consolidated
list here as a touchpoint for discussion. Please consider offering
feedback to the articles that use these terms via the IDPro GitHub
repository:

Note that even this long list of activities is not exhaustive: other activities may also fall within the definition of "processing". Additional rules, in Article 22, apply to "automated individual decision-making, including profiling".
