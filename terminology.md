# Terminology in the IDPro Body of Knowledge

Heather Flanagan, editor - ©2024 IDPro

***Editor’s Note:** This is a consolidated list of the terminology
highlighted in each of the articles published in the Body of Knowledge
(BoK). It is not, by any means, a definitive or even broadly supported
set of definitions; the context an individual reader brings to the table
will influence how accurate the terminology for their use case. We offer
the consolidated list here as a touchpoint for discussion. Article
authors are encouraged to review and use existing definitions before
offering new ones for terms already described in the BoK.*

*You are encouraged to also read the article, “*[Words of
Identity](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/86/)*” by Espen Bago, for a
cautious view of how, despite efforts like this Terminology document,
words in the IAM space are often ambiguous.*

*Please consider offering feedback to the articles that use these terms
via the IDPro GitHub repository: <https://github.com/IDPros/bok>.*
