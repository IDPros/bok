About OpenID Connect
====================

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a framework that facilitates the creation of a
secure Internet identity
ecosystem.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>
It provides seamless integration and robust support while prioritizing
security and privacy configurations. Additionally, it promotes
interoperability and boasts widespread client and device support.

Authorization Servers implementing the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol
are called OpenID Providers (OP). A Relying Party (RP) connects to the
OP to obtain an ID token as an assertion that the user has successfully
authenticated and to receive a unique identifier representing the user.
Additional purposes are ensuring the user is authorized for requested
access and obtaining user attributes. The OP may authenticate users
directly or delegate authentication to federated or non-federated
Identity Providers (IDPs) to facilitate sign-in flows on web or mobile
applications and share user profile information upon successful
authentication. OpenID Connect does not define how OPs integrate with
federated IDPs. Such integrations are left to the implementation details
of the OP. The OP may act as a bridge in these cases, using proprietary
or other non-standard protocols to authenticate users via the federated
IDPs.

RPs use the authenticated user claims found in the issued tokens to
comprehend the user's authentication process and the level of assurance,
allowing RPs to make well-informed decisions.

For this article, the federated IDP flow is referenced. Note that OIDC
does not mandate or standardize how federated IDPs are integrated. These
integrations depend on the implementation details of the OP and may
involve non-standard protocols or proprietary methods.

Background
----------

The OAuth 2.0 specification defines a framework where clients or Relying
Parties (RPs) connect with Resource Servers to access API resources on
behalf of resource
owners.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>
The OP is pivotal in allowing this integration between the parties
involved.

Bertrand Carlier's article "[<span class="underline">An Introduction to
OAuth 2.0</span>](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/99/)" in the IDPro
Body of Knowledge provides a comprehensive overview of OAuth 2.0 and
touches on OIDC. It is a valuable starting point for understanding these
widely used protocols and covers fundamental terminology and references
to IETF RFC details that describe the protocols.

OIDC emphasizes user authentication and introduces the concept of the ID
Token. This token is exchanged between the OP and RP. It takes the form
of a JSON Web Token (JWT) and communicates details about the
authenticated user's identity through predefined [<span
class="underline">standard
claims</span>](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)
and information related to the authentication
process.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,</sup>
<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup>
<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>

The OIDC specification allows RPs to access more detailed user
information through the UserInfo endpoint, a protected resource in the
OAuth 2.0 framework. During the authentication process, RPs can request
user claims from this endpoint using the Access Token obtained from the
OP. The user claims are returned as a JSON object containing name-value
pairs, providing comprehensive user information to the RP.

Terminology
-----------

Terminology is primarily derived from the [Terminology in the IDPro Body
of Knowledge](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/41/).

| Resource Server           | The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens. Typically, exposed as an API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [<span class="underline">The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</span>](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.1)                                             |

We will use the more common Relying Party (or RP). An RP roughly corresponds to the Agency Endpoint in the FICAM model or to Identity Consumers in the Internet2 model. | [IAM Reference Architecture](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/76/)                                                                                                            |

Tokens
======

The Authorization Code flow is the most commonly used method for RPs to
obtain tokens in OIDC. This flow ensures secure communication between
the RP and the Authorization Server through the following steps:

1.  User Authentication: The RP redirects the user to the Authorization
    Server, where the user logs in.

2.  Authorization Code Issuance: After successful authentication, the
    Authorization Server issues an Authorization Code to the RP.

3.  Token Exchange: The RP exchanges the Authorization Code for tokens
    via a secure back-channel server-to-server call. These tokens
    typically include:

    -   ID Token: Provides authenticated user identity claims.

    -   Access Token: Grants access to protected resources.

    -   Refresh Token (optional): Allows the RP to obtain new Access
        Tokens without requiring the user to log in again.

To enhance security, particularly for public clients, the Proof Key for
Code Exchange (PKCE) extension is
mandatory.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a>
While PKCE is mandatory for public clients, its use is also encouraged
for confidential clients to provide additional protection against
interception attacks. PKCE mitigates interception attacks by binding the
authorization request to the token exchange
process.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a>

ID Token
--------

The ID Token is a critical element of OpenID Connect, designed to
securely communicate user authentication details. It is structured as a
JWT and includes claims such as:

-   sub: A unique identifier for the authenticated user.

-   Optional Claims: Additional claims like name, profile, or email,
    which must be explicitly requested using scopes (e.g., openid,
    profile, email).

To ensure integrity, the Authorization Server digitally signs the ID
Token using JSON Web Signature
(JWS).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a>
For enhanced confidentiality, the ID Token can also be encrypted with
JSON Web Encryption (JWE) using symmetric or asymmetric
algorithms.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a>

Both Access Tokens and ID Tokens have expiration times to ensure
security. RPs should validate the expiration (exp) claim in tokens
before processing them.

Multiple Hops Omitted
---------------------

This explanation omits intermediate browser redirects for brevity,
focusing instead on the core interactions between the RP and the
Authorization Server.

UserInfo Endpoint
=================

The UserInfo endpoint is a key feature of OIDC, enabling RPs to retrieve
additional user claims beyond those provided in the ID Token. Common
claims retrieved via the UserInfo endpoint include name, email,
birthdate, and address, depending on the scopes requested by the RP.
These claims, formatted as a JSON object, offer more detailed
information about the userâs profile or authentication process.

RPs should follow the principle of data minimization by requesting only
the claims necessary for their application to function.

Access and Authorization
------------------------

The UserInfo endpoint requires an Access Token, issued by the
Authorization Server during the authorization process, to authenticate
and authorize requests. The claims available from the UserInfo endpoint
depend on:

-   The scopes requested during the authorization process (e.g.,
    profile, email).

-   The OpenID Provider's (OP) configuration and policies.

RPs may also explicitly request specific claims using the claims
parameter in the authorization request. This allows for fine-grained
control over the user information retrieved from the OP.

Optional Claims and Provider Discretion
---------------------------------------

The OP determines which claims are included in the ID Token and which
are provided through the UserInfo endpoint. Not all claims in the ID
Token are guaranteed to be available via the UserInfo endpoint. This
separation ensures flexibility while adhering to privacy and security
considerations.

Data Security
-------------

To ensure confidentiality, the response from the UserInfo endpoint can
be encrypted using JWE. This encryption can be implemented using
symmetric or asymmetric algorithms, depending on the RPâs requirements,
to safeguard sensitive user information during transmission.

Enhanced Decision-Making
------------------------

The detailed claims retrieved from the UserInfo endpoint empower RPs to
make informed decisions about user access, authentication levels, and
personalized experiences within their applications.

By offering this additional layer of user information, the UserInfo
endpoint complements the ID Token, allowing RPs to access a richer set
of data while maintaining robust security and privacy standards.

OIDC Flow
=========

OIDC provides a secure framework for authenticating users and exchanging
identity information between RPs and OPs In some cases, the OP may
delegate authentication to an external IDP. The typical sequence of the
OIDC flow includes the following steps:

1.  RP Initiates Authentication: The RP redirects the user to the OP's
    Authorization Server, initiating the authentication process.

2.  Authentication via Federated IDP (Optional): If the OP integrates
    with a federated IDP, it forwards the authentication request to the
    IDP. The IDP authenticates the user and may bypass the login screen
    if the user is already authenticated.

3.  Authorization Code Issuance: Once the user is authenticated, the
    Authorization Server issues an Authorization Code to the RP via the
    user's browser.

<!-- -->

1.  Token Exchange: The RP exchanges the Authorization Code for tokens
    in a secure back-channel request to the Authorization Server. These
    tokens include:

    -   ID Token: Contains identity claims about the authenticated user.

    -   Access Token: Used to access protected resources.

    -   Refresh Token (optional): Enables the RP to obtain new Access
        Tokens without reauthenticating the user.

2.  Optional UserInfo Query: The RP may query the UserInfo endpoint
    using the Access Token to retrieve additional claims that were not
    included in the ID Token. These claims can offer more detailed
    information about the userâs profile or authentication.

3.  Access Protected Resources: The RP uses the Access Token to interact
    with the Resource Server and access the requested protected
    resources.

Additional Notes

-   Flexibility in Claims Sharing: The OP and, if applicable, the IDP
    may provide claims through their respective UserInfo endpoints. This
    flexibility allows RPs to access detailed user profiles tailored to
    their needs.

-   Simplified Representation: This explanation omits intermediate
    browser redirects and technical details for brevity.

-   Error Handling: If an error occurs at any step, such as invalid
    credentials or an expired authorization code, the OP should return
    an error response detailing the reason. RPs must handle these errors
    gracefully to provide feedback to the user.

By following this structured flow, OIDC ensures secure and reliable
authentication while providing a flexible mechanism for retrieving
identity and profile information. This enables RPs to create
personalized and secure user experiences.

Logout
======

OIDC supports RP-initiated and back-channel logout mechanisms. However,
the implementation of these protocols varies among OPs. RPs should
consult the OP's metadata to determine the supported logout methods. The
OP and IDP can provide logout endpoints for the RP to call during the
user logout flow. Logout endpoints ensure no further calls can be made
to the Resource Server using invalidated access tokens. In addition to
invalidating tokens, RPs should ensure session cookies are cleared to
fully terminate the user's session.

RP-initiated and back-channel logout are two mechanisms for ending a
user session on the Identity Provider and invalidating the associated
tokens.

-   RP-Initiated Logout ( [<span
    class="underline">https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1\_0.html</span>](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html)
    )

-   Back Channel Logout ( [<span
    class="underline">https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1\_0.html</span>](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)
    )

Some OPs also support Single Logout (SLO), enabling simultaneous session
termination across multiple RPs. RPs should review the OP's metadata to
determine the supported logout methods and endpoints.

In general, implementations of logout mechanisms may vary significantly
across OPs. RPs should test these flows thoroughly to ensure
compatibility.

Discovery
=========

The OpenID Connect (OIDC) discovery mechanism simplifies the integration
of Relying Parties (RPs) with OpenID Providers (OPs) by providing a
standardized method for retrieving configuration metadata. This metadata
is accessible at a well-known URL: /.well-known/openid-configuration.

Metadata Overview
-----------------

The discovery document includes essential details about the OP's
capabilities, such as:

-   **Endpoints:** URLs for token issuance, user authentication, and the
    UserInfo API.

-   **Supported Grant Types:** Information on flows like authorization
    code and implicit.

-   **Cryptographic Algorithms:** Supported methods for signing and
    encrypting tokens.

-   **Scopes and Claims:** Available scopes and the claims that can be
    requested by RPs.

The metadata also supports dynamic client registration, allowing RPs to
programmatically register with the OP. This feature automates
integration, reducing manual setup and ensuring consistency across
different implementations. Dynamic client registration should be
protected with appropriate measures, such as client authentication or
pre-authorization by the OP, to prevent misuse.

Interoperability and Security
-----------------------------

By centralizing these configuration details, the discovery mechanism:

-   Streamlines the setup process for RPs.

-   Enhances interoperability between systems.

-   Improves security by ensuring that the RP operates with accurate,
    up-to-date information.

Best Practices
--------------

RPs should periodically validate the information retrieved from the
discovery document to account for any updates or changes in the OP's
configuration. This ensures seamless operation and adherence to the
latest security standards.

The discovery mechanism is a cornerstone of OIDC's flexibility, enabling
a wide range of applications to integrate quickly and securely with
OpenID Providers.

Beyond The Introduction
=======================

In addition to what has been mentioned in this introduction, the OIDC
specification covers a wide range of measures to ensure the secure
transmission of user data. Several other topics are included that can
enhance the authentication process.
