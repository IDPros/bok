Technical
---------

Most organizations that maintain an enterprise architecture start with
the Technical Architecture (TA). It's the component that delivers the
greatest return on investment.

The TA is informed by the work being performed by the organization, the
people doing it and the location at which it is being done. An
up-to-date TA will ensure that the IT infrastructure supports the
business requirements.

The TA will typically define the "patterns" to be supported by the
organization.

For young companies this will be web-based patterns either "2 tier" or
"n-tier". Increasingly managed cloud environments are being engaged,
potentially with a micro-services approach. But for mature organizations
there will typically be legacy applications with a client-server
pattern, or even a mainframe with PCs running terminal emulators. The
IdM environment must include the main patterns in use within the
organization. The sooner an organization can limit the number of
supported patterns, the greater the savings on the IT budget.

The IAM environment must support the selected patterns and ensure a
managed approach that adheres to the organization's governance and cyber
security policy is followed. For instance, synchronizing identity data
to multiple SaaS apps each night is not an acceptable practice.
Deploying a cloud-based identity provider service, or an IDentity-as
a-Service (IDaas) facility should be considered.
